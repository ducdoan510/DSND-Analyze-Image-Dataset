# DSND-Analyze-Image-Dataset

## Overview
This project classifies the image dataset with transfer learning method using PyTorch. On second part of the project, a simple CLI application is implemented to allow user to classify own images

## Instruction


## File structure
1. Part 1: contains the Jupiter notebook that preprocesses the image data and train the classifier using transfer learning with PyTorch
2. Part 2: a Python module extracting the code from the notebook
  - image.py: utility functions that process image data
  - model.py: utility functions that train the image classifier
  - train.py: entry point for CLI application for creating the model checkpoint for customized classifier
  - predict.py: entry point for CLI application that uses the checkpoint to load the model to predict image class
